### Required EDA software
1. Open the PowerShell and install WSL<br>
`wsl --install -d Ubuntu-22.04`<br>
You will be prompted to create a UNIX username and password.<br>
This UNIX username and password have no relationship to your Windows username and password.<br>
To avoid any confusion use a different username
2. [Install Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)<br>
3. Start Ubuntu (either by typing `wsl` into the Windows's PowerShell or selecting the Ubuntu app in the Window's Start Menu) <br>
Your unix user's home directory is:<br>
`/home/<unix username>`<br>
Your Windows user's home directory is:<br>
`/mnt/c/Users/<windows username>`
5. clone the [iic-osic-tools](https://github.com/iic-jku/IIC-OSIC-TOOLS) container onto your computer (for example into your Windows user's folder)<br>
`git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/iic-jku/iic-osic-tools.git`<br>
*Example*<br>
Windows user's folder: `C:\Users\claudio`<br>
In Unix, the Windows user's folder is accessible as:
`/mnt/c/Users/claudio`<br>
5. Start Docker Desktop
6. Browse to the iic-osic-tools directory<br>
`cd /mnt/c/Users/claudio/iic-osic-tools`<be>
7. Start the container using the script `./start_x.sh`<br>
**NOTE:** in the script, all user data is persistently mounted in the directory pointed to by the environment variable `DESIGNS` <br>
The default is `$HOME/eda/designs`<br>
To change where the user data is mounted edit the `./start_x.sh` script and modify the definition of the variable `DESIGNS`<br>
*Example*<br>
`DESIGNS="/mnt/g/My Drive/eda/designs"`
8. In the unfortunate event that .Xauthority does not exist in the user home directory, it will show the below error:<br>
   ```
   xauth
   xauth:  file /root/.Xauthority does not exist
   Using authority file /root/.Xauthority
   ```
   Below are the steps to manually create .Xauthority under the user home directory:<br>
   ```
   touch ~/.Xauthority
   # Generate the magic cookie with 128 bit hex encoding
   xauth add ${HOST}:0 . $(xxd -l 16 -p /dev/urandom)
   # Verify the result and it shouldn't show any error
   xauth list
   ```

9. If everything goes as it should, you will see a terminal with the prompt `/foss/designs >` <br>
This is your working directory where all your design data goes.<br>
If you are curious to see what version of the iic osic tools you are runnig use the command:<br>
`echo $IIC_OSIC_TOOLS_VERSION`

11. The default PDK is the `sky130A`. However, the container supports also other PDKs.<br>
    The available PDKs are:<br>
    ```
    gf180mcuC
    sg13g2
    sky130A
    ```
    If you want to switch to the IHP PDK type:<br>
    ```
    iic-pdk sg13g2
    ```
    To skip typing this command every time, create a `.designinit` text file in your design directory with the following lines:
    ```
    PDK_ROOT=/foss/pdks
    PDK=sg13g2
    PDKPATH=/foss/pdks/sg13g2
    ```
    For more information about the sg13g2 technology lookup the [IHP github](https://github.com/IHP-GmbH/IHP-Open-PDK)
